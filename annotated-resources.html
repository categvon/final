<p><strong>1. Article: An analysis of RBMS news blog job advertisements, 2013–2021 by Ikumi Crocoll and Kelli Hansen (2021)</strong> Crocoll and Hansen researched job advertisements posted on the RBMS News Blog from 2013 to 2021. Their key findings included that almost all the positions advertised were in the United States, with the top states including California, New York, Texas, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania, most institutions represented were universities, and only 1% were specifically designed for recent graduates. By examining these postings over time, the article shows how the role within the RBMC sector has evolved in response to changing technologies and library needs.

<p><strong>2. Webinar: Oral History in Action: Building Partnerships and Programs at LAPL with Ani Boyadjian and Zack Ellis.</strong> This webinar features our professional interviewee, Ani Boyadjian, in conversation with Zack Ellis, who founded TheirStory, an integrated platform for capturing oral histories. They discuss the importance of oral histories as primary sources, challenges to capturing, archiving and maintaining audio, and the function of the system and platforms available to LAPL. This is an excellent and contemporary resource for understanding the role of systems and infrastructure for special collections librarianship.</p>

<p><strong>3. Article: Reframing the Archival Gaze: Critical Race Theory and the Ethics of Special Collections" by Michelle Caswell and Andrew Flinn (2019)</strong> Caswell and Flinn’s article critically applies a CRT framework to assess how the "archival gaze" shapes historical narratives and the preservation of knowledge. They examine how archives and special collections reflect and reinforce power structures that perpetuate racial marginalization and advocate for more inclusive practices.

<p><strong>4. Blog Post: “Confession: I’m an accidental music librarian” by Gillian Robbins (2020)</strong> This blog post by Gillian Robbins, a special collections librarian at the Edwin A. Fleisher Collection of Orchestral Music at the Free Library of Philadelphia, is a personal account of her journey into the field of music librarianship. Her writing speaks to how career paths, especially in special collections, aren’t always linear and her experience highlights the value of flexibility, adaptability and enthusiasm in developing expertise in specialized collections.</p>

<p><strong>5. Blog Post: “It’s the Collections that are Special” by Lisa Carter (2009)</strong> This blog post by Lisa Carter, upon her appointment as Visiting Program Officer for the Association of Research Libraries Special Collections Working Group, is a useful reference for understanding the way that special collections occupy a privileged role within libraries, in terms of distinguishing institutions and in terms of perpetuating barriers to access. She outlines strategies for streamlining community access to special collections, improving teaching and research efforts, and ways to dismantle the privileging of special collections with intentional integration efforts.
